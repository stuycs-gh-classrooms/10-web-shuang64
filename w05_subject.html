      <h2>What is Trigonometry on a Right Triangle?</h2>
      <p>The field of mathematics called Trigonometry is the study of right triangles and the ratio between the sides. 
        For similar right triangles, the ratio of corrresponding sides are proportional,
        meaning that the size of the triangles does not alter the  side ratios. Three basic trig ratios include sine, which
        is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse; cosine, the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse; and
        tangent, the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side. Other trigonometric ratios include secant, cosecant, 
        and cotangent. The Greek letter theta is frequently used to represent an angle, measured in either degree or radian.

      <h2>What are Rotations?</h2>
      <p>The measure of an angle is determined by the amount and direction of rotation from the initial side, positive x-axis,
        to the terminal side. The vertex of an angle is located at the origin. A positive angle would indicate moving in a counter
        clockwise rotation, while a negative angle moves in a clockwise rotation. If the terminal side of an angle in standard position
        lies on a coordinate axis, then the angle is classified as a quadrantal angle (90, 180, 270, 360 degrees). Coterminal angles 
        are angles in standard position that have the same sides. Every angle has an unlimited number of coterminal angles. An easy way 
        to find examples of coterminal angles include adding or subtracting 360 degrees or a multiple of 360 from the given angle. 
        Reference angles are positive acute angles that are formed by the terminal ray and x-axis.

      <h2>How to Evaluate y=asin(bx)?</h2>
      <p>The value of a represents the vertical dilation of a sine or cosine function, the maximum and minimum y-values,
        and also indicates whether there is a reflection over the x-axis, if there is a negative sign. Amplitude is defined to 
        be half the difference between the maximum height and the minimum height, or in other words,the absolute value of the a value.
        The period, P, of a sine or cosine function is defined as the minimum horizontal displacement needed for a sinusoidal curve
        to complete one cycle, represented by 2pi divided by the abslute value of the b value. Frequency, B, is represented by the 
        absolute value of the b value, and is defined as the number of full cycles made within 2pi radians by the curve.
